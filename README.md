# 10_3_3-FixIDEScrollBar
Fixes the Code Complete dangling scroll bar issue.

When you're in a Delphi project, and press Ctrl Spacebar to activate Code Completion, followed by Ctrl F9, the scrollbar from the Code Completion window will be left dangling.

After installing this package, the dangling scrollbar will no longer be an issue.
